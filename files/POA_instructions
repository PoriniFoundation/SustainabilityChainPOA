# fast version in Linux:
>git clone https://github.com/PoriniFoundation/SustainabilityChainPOA/
>cd SustainabilityChainPOA
>c+x start.sh
>sudo ./start.sh

in a new terminal
>geth attach SustainabilityChainPOA/node1/geth.ipc

and when the javaconsole starts:

>load scripts("files/scripts.js")
>scripts()

create an account with a good passwort 

personal.newAccount("pwdnode123ThisShouldBeAGoodPassword")

Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password. NOBODY CAN RESTORE THIS PASSWORD EVER.


This creates the keystore/ folder containing your account file and your Ethereum adress. 
Notice that the last part of the file name in keystore/ is the address of your account (also printed in the terminal just above).


check if it is synced 
>net
make sure there is more than 0 nodes connected

>eth.blocknumer
make sure it is not zero

>eth.syncing
false
if the response to the question syncing? is false then the chain is synced
propose your address to be a authority sealer
share your address with Porini Foundation (info@porini.foundation) and the other authorities so that we can accept your node using the same clique command
>>clique.propose("0x...", true)

MAKE SURE YOUR NODE IS ALWAYS ONLINE, OR INSTALL IT ON A FEW COMPUTERS SO THAT ALWAYS ONE OF THE SEALERS CONNECTED TO THIS ADDRESS IS ONLINE
OTHERWISE IT ENDANGERS THE SEALING CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE CHAIN WHERE ALWAYS n/2 + 1 NODE HAVE TO BE ONLINE TO ENABLE SEALING (WHICH IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FEW AUTHORITIES E.G. N=3 THEN ALL THREE NODES HAVE TO BE ONLINE....
e.g. use nohup to keep the node running
