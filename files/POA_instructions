# tutorial to run a node for SustainabilityChain proof of Authority/Alliance

1) make sure you have geth installed
>geth version
if you don't have it follow the tutorial here https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Installing-Geth

2) get this repository
>git clone https://github.com/PoriniFoundation/SustainabilityChainPOA/
>cd SustainabilityChainPOA
>mkdir node1

3)initialize geth 
>geth --datadir node1/ init files/genesis001.json

4) start the node
>nohup geth --datadir ./node1 --syncmode 'full' --port 30411 --rpc --rpcaddr 'localhost' --rpcport 8551 --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpccorsdomain "*" --rpcapi 'personal,db,eth,net,web3,txpool,miner' --bootnodes 'enode://45edb69e3be951065f3425f9fe35591d52e906359e10dbaf1b7a2259c9772022b79831f2f9836d54d607ef837d319fc4f52cce991489ba9babd3602f2289e4eb@[52.59.201.140]:30411' --networkid 19760307001 &&

5) do some checks in the javaconsole
in a new window open the javaconsole
>geth attach SustainabilityChainPOA/node1/geth.ipc

Optional:in the javaconsole connect to more bootnodes
>load scripts("../files/scripts/start.js")
>start.js()

create an account with a good passwort 
>personal.newAccount("pwdnode123ThisShouldBeAGoodPassword")

Your new account is locked with a password. Please find a good password. 
This creates the keystore/ folder containing your account file and your Ethereum adress. 
Do not forget this password. NOBODY CAN RESTORE THIS PASSWORD EVER. Also make a backup of the UTC-....json file in the folder SustainabilityChain/node1/keystore


check if the node is synced 
>net
make sure there is more than 0 nodes connected

>eth.blocknumer
make sure it is not zero

>eth.syncing
false
false is the good answer, it means the chain is is synced (if blocknumer>1)

6) CELEBRATE
CONGRATULATIONS: TIME TO CELEBRATE, YOU RUN A NODE OF SUSTAINABILITY-CHAIN POA

if you want to become a member of the alliance:

propose your address to be a authority sealer using clique.propose
at the moment (August 2018) you best share your address with Porini Foundation (info@porini.foundation) and the other authorities so that we can accept your node using the same clique command
>>clique.propose("0x...", true)

MAKE SURE YOUR NODE IS ALWAYS ONLINE, OR INSTALL IT ON A FEW COMPUTERS SO THAT ALWAYS ONE OF THE SEALERS CONNECTED TO THIS ADDRESS IS ONLINE
OTHERWISE IT ENDANGERS THE SEALING CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE CHAIN WHERE ALWAYS n/2 + 1 NODE HAVE TO BE ONLINE TO ENABLE SEALING (WHICH IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FEW AUTHORITIES E.G. N=3 THEN ALL THREE NODES HAVE TO BE ONLINE....
e.g. use nohup to keep the node running
