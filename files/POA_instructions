These are instructions to run a SustainabilityChain POA in Linux

make sure you have ethereum and geth installed:
>geth version

get the SustainabilityChain POA001 genesisfile here
>git clone https://github.com/PoriniFoundation/SustainabilityChainPOA/
go to that directory
>cd SustainabilityChainPOA


create a workspace for your node
>mkdir node1
>cd node1

create an account with a good passwort 
> geth --datadir node1/ account new
Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.
Passphrase: pwdnode123ThisShouldBeAGoodPassword (for example)
Repeat passphrase: pwdnode123ThisShouldBeAGoodPassword
Address: {87366ef81d4444edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec2ww}

This creates the keystore/ folder containing your account file. 
Notice that the last part of the file name in keystore/ is the address of your account (also printed in the terminal just above).

Initialize the node with the correct parameters that are defined in genesis001.json
>geth --datadir node1/ init files/genesis001.json

initialize a bootnode to be detected
>bootnode -genkey boot.key
The bootnode is usually ran on a static IP and thus acts like a pub where nodes know they will find the other bootnodes

start the bootnode service 
>bootnode -nodekey boot.key -verbosity 9 -addr :30310
INFO [02-07|22:44:09] UDP listener upself=enode://3ec4fef2d726c2c01f16f0a0030f15dd5a81e274067af2b2157cafbf76aa79fa9c0be52c6664e80cc5b08162ede53279bd70ee10d024fe86613b0b09e1106c40@[::]:30310
if you want to share this ensure that you put your IP in here [::] like [123:4:5:67] 

Feel free to use any port you like but please avoid the mainstream ones (like 80 for HTTP). 30303 is used for the public ethereum networks.

in a new window
start your node
geth --datadir node1/ --syncmode 'full' --port 30311 --rpc --rpcaddr 'localhost' --rpcport 8501 --rpcapi 'personal,db,eth,net,web3,txpool,miner' --bootnodes 'enode://3ec4fef2d726c2c01f16f0a0030f15dd5a81e274067af2b2157cafbf76aa79fa9c0be52c6664e80cc5b08162ede53279bd70ee10d024fe86613b0b09e1106c40@127.0.0.1:30310' --networkid 19760307001 --gasprice '1' -unlock '87366ef81d4444edd0ea2055ca605e8686eec2ww' --password pwdnode123ThisShouldBeAGoodPassword --mine

wait fo the blockchain to be synced
check if it is synced 
>geth attach node1/geth.ipc
>>net
make sure there is more than 0 nodes connected
>>eth.syncing
false
if the response to the question syncing? is false then the chain is synced
propose your address to be a authority sealer
share your address with Porini Foundation and the other authorities so that we can accept your node using the same clique command
>>clique.propose("0x...", true)

MAKE SURE YOUR NODE IS ALWAYS ONLINE, OR INSTALL IT ON A FEW COMPUTERS SO THAT ALWAYS ONE OF THE SEALERS CONNECTED TO THIS ADDRESS IS ONLINE
OTHERWISE IT ENDANGERS THE SEALING CAPACITY OF THE ENTIRE CHAIN WHERE ALWAYS n/2 + 1 NODE HAVE TO BE ONLINE TO ENABLE SEALING (WHICH IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FEW AUTHORITIES E.G. N=3 THEN ALL THREE NODES HAVE TO BE ONLINE....
e.g. use nohup to keep the node running
